**NOTE**: This project represents the final project supported and realized within the Neueonal Networks laboratories of the Faculty of Informatics of the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University in IaÈ™i, Romania.

<h3 align="left">Here we have the requirement:</h3>

Implement and train a neural network using the Q learning algorithm to control an agent in the Flappy Bird game.

<h3 align="left">Environment:</h3>

You can use a Flappy Bird environment from [here](https://pypi.org/project/flappy-bird-gymnasium/) or [here](https://github.com/Talendar/flappy-bird-gym) or another environment. Why not create your own? If you use a pre-made environment, make sure you can render the environment and interact with it.

<h3 align="left">Specifications:</h3>

You can train the model directly on images (the model receives the pixels) or you can extract helpful features. Based on the input you are using for the model, the maximum score is capped to:

- 20 points: if you provide the game state directly (this might include positions of the pipes, bird, direction, simple distances)
- 25 points: if you provide preprocessed features (this might include more complex features extracted from the image: e.g. sensors/lidar for the bird)
- 30 points: if you use the image as input, eventually preprocessed, if needed (resizing, grayscale conversion, thresholding, dilation, erosion, background removal, etc.)

It is not necessary to implement the neural network from scratch (you can use PyTorch), but you must implement the Q learning algorithm.

<h3 id="inst" align="left">Installation:</h3>

1. Clone the current repositoy! Now you have the project avalable on your local server!</br>
 Type command: ```git clone git@github.com:AndromedaOMA/FlappyNet.git```
2. Select, open and run the FlappyNet project through PyCharm IDE or the preferred IDE.
3. Have fun!
